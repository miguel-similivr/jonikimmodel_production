            <p>Joni is a Vancouver based model represented by Charles Stuart International.</p>
            <p>Standing at 5 feet 5 inches, her work has garnered international attention. She has been featured three times in the Vogue.it website and has been published in magazines based in Toronto, LA, Chicago, New York, and Paris.</p>
            <p>For Joni, being a model is all about being a living and breathing work of art. She sees herself as a blank canvas for other artists to paint on, collaborating as a team to achieve a distinct aesthetic.</p>
            <p>Joni wants viewers of her photos to talk about the artwork as a whole. She wants them to think “Look at what she’s wearing. That’s a fantastic outfit!”. Or “I like what they did with her makeup!”.</p>
            <p>On her spare time, Joni loves to sing and make music. She is also an avid runner and fitness enthusiast.</p>
